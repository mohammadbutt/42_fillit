# Project Status - In Progress
# Fillit - An Algorithm to put tetrominoes in a smallest square possible

# Brainstorming
- [X] 1. Open the file
- [X] 2. Read the file
- [X] 3. Print the file
- [X] 4. Save 19 valid pieces in a .c file. Put the pieces at the top left position. Using `ft_strcpy()`, instead of `malloc()`, so there is no need to free allocated memory.
- [X] 5. Migrating to valid pieces over to macros because it is a better option.
- [ ] 6. Move the pieces of a given file to our desired location which is to the top left. Use x, y coordinates to move the pieces.
- [ ] 7. `ft_strcmp` can be used to compare pieces of the user with the valid pieces.
